The first file, AA-begin-font.py, creates an empty font.

The other files all draw one glyph into the font.

zz-finalise-font.py then adapts all the widths of the glyphs
to their extrema.

You can run one script by giving such a command in the terminal:

python michela-albertini.py

As a shortcut to run all the scripts at once, run:

./compile
